                    <p class="hobbySectionP">Professionally, cricket is played on an open field. These are purpose-built fields designed specifically for cricket, with a large oval-shaped playing area and a central pitch.</p>
                    <p class="hobbySectionP">Parks and ovals are public spaces with large open fields that can be used for cricket. They may not have the same level of facilities as a dedicated cricket ground, but they are often free or low-cost to use and can be a great option for casual games or training.</p>
                    <p class="hobbySectionP">There are also indoor facilities, these are enclosed spaces with artificial pitches and netting, designed for year-round cricket training and play. Indoor facilities can be especially useful in areas with inclement weather or limited outdoor space.</p>
