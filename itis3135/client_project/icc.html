                <h3>ICC</h3>

                <p>ICC stands for International Cricket Council, which is the governing body of international cricket. It was founded in 1909 and currently has 12 full members and 92 associate members. The ICC is responsible for organizing major cricket events such as the Cricket World Cup, the ICC Champions Trophy, and the ICC World Twenty20. It also governs the rules and regulations of the game, and works to promote cricket around the world.</p>
                <p>Cricket is played internationally in three formats: Test matches, One-Day Internationals, and Twenty20 Internationals. The International Cricket Council regulates these matches and provides match officials.</p>

                    <h4 class="accordian">Test Cricket</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>Test cricket is the traditional form of the game, which has been played since 1877 and now settled in a five-day format which comprises two innings each. It is considered the pinnacle form because it tests teams over a longer period of time. Teams need to exhibit endurance, technique and temperament in different conditions to do well in this format.</p>

                    <h4 class="accordian">One Day Internationals</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>One Day Internationals, also known as ODIs, are a pacier format which started in 1971 but gained in popularity from the 1980s. These are one-innings matches of 50 overs per side, in which teams with a blend of technique, speed and skill are expected to do well. The ICCâ€™s pinnacle event, the ICC Cricket World Cup, is contested every four years in this format.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h4 class="accordian">Twenty20</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>Twenty20 Internationals are the newest, shortest and fastest form of the game. This format of 20 overs per side has brought in new audiences since its advent in 2005 and also triggered new skill sets and innovations. A Twenty20 International match is usually competed in three hours and with huge hitting, skillful bowling and amazing fielding it has been hugely popular with fans right around the world. </p>
