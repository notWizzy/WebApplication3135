                <p>Cricket may have originated in the Weald region of south-east England during Saxon or Norman times. In 1611, it was first mentioned as an adult sport, though it had been considered a boys' game. There is a belief that cricket may have evolved from the game of bowls. By the 17th century, village cricket was established, and county teams emerged later in the century. The earliest professionals were recruited from local cricket experts. The use of county names in games was first recorded in 1709.</p>

                <p>Cricket gained popularity in London and south-eastern counties of England in the 18th Century. Women's Cricket began in 1745 in Surrey. The first Laws of Cricket were written in 1744 and amended in 1774 to include innovations such as lbw, a 3rd stump, and a maximum bat width. The codes were developed by the "Star and Garter Club," whose members founded the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1787. MCC has been the custodian of the Laws and continues to revise them.</p>

                <p>In 1760, bowlers began pitching the ball, and the straight bat replaced the old "hockey-stick" style. The Hambledon Club was the game's focal point for thirty years until MCC and Lord's Cricket Ground opened in 1787. Cricket spread globally in the 18th and 19th centuries, introduced to North America, West Indies, India, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa by colonists and British East India Company mariners.</p>
